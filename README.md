# DRIT (Feature Dimension Reduction using Intermediate Model Training)

Feature Transformation through Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach for improving model accuracy through feature transformation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The method involves training a model on the original dataset and then transforming the data into principal components using PCA or a similar dimensionality reduction technique. The principal components are then used to train a new model, aiming to achieve higher accuracy.

### Methodology
1 Data Preprocessing:

* Ensure the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed appropriately for model training.

2 Model Training:

* Train a machine learning model on the original dataset to establish a baseline performance.

3 Dimensionality Reduction:

* Utilize PCA to transform the original features into principal components. This reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its variance.

4 Final Model Training:

* Train a new model using the principal components obtained from the previous step. This final model aims to capture the essential information present in the data represented by the principal components.

5 Model Evaluation:

* Evaluate the performance of the final model on a validation set to assess its accuracy compared to the baseline model.
